This project presents a theoretical approach to integrating computer vision with large language models (LLMs) and movement-based AI systems. It aims to enable advanced locomotion, spatial awareness, and vocal input processing. Created as a proof of concept by BMK for Alan Fern at Oregon State University (OSU).
